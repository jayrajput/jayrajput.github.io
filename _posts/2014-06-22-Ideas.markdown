*   A open-source evaluator which can be used for evalution. 
*   Phone Time Base Profile. When I am in office set to VIBRATE, else set to SOUND.
*   Recursive alarm. useful for alarm for medicine which needs to be taken on alternate days.
*   Pdf File format with metadata, so that user can save metadata inside it. For books, you can store author name, book name, type and other details.
*   Test Execution Reporting Tool. A big project with support fo RTM.
*   Library/function to pretty print PHP arrays, associative array.
