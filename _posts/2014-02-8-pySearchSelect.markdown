Title: Python Search Select

There has been multiple times when working on the shell that you would have thought of creating a interactive list. Bash provides SELECT which can be used to create inteactive list but it is pretty basic. More interactive list can be created with curses. You never roll out a curses from scratch and will use some sort of library. If you are into python and use this library called urwid, you can gain by the work done by me called "Python Search Select". Read more about it on github.
