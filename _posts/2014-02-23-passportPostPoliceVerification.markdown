title:  Passport Post Police Verfication

I applied for my Indian passport reissue on 6-Feb-2014. After interview at PSK
(Passport Seva Kendra), they gave me a receipt at the end which said "Post
Verification" as "Police Verification Mode".  I did not knew what "Post
Verification" means at that time and this post is to share my experience about
the same.

I waited for some police person to arrive at my home for verification.  Passport
Office was sending me notifications (sms/mails) which was very nice to track
the status of the application. 

Post Verification means that your passport will be issued first, but the
verification can happen after that.  You need to have proofs of stay at the
current address.  And have two witness ready to sign a form acknowledging that
you are staying in the current address for about a year.  Preferred witness are
neighbors/landlord living near to your home (preferably under the same local
police station).

As part of police verification, I was called by a police man who asked me for a
form to be signed by two witness and provide proofs of stay. Telephone bills
can also be used as a proof.
