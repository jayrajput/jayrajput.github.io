Title: VIM other movement commands (H, M, L , zz, zb, zt)

I always struggled with the usage of the vim other movement commands.  I
recently found a usage for zz but I still have to found the usage for remaining
others.

* Use it when browsing the page. I found it that when browsing the help page,
 it was helpful to use zz to center the current line so that I can see what is
 beyond the current line.
* When in insert mode while editing an existing file, it is something useful to
 see what is before (or after) the current line. In insert mode, C-o,
 followed by zz can be used.


In place of H, M, L, there are other commands which can be used. Like { and },
so I have never able to find the usage for H, M, L, zb and zt.
