title: CSS Class Prefix Trick
---

This is a little nugget I learned while following an online course.

The CSS classes can be used for two reasons

- Actually styling the element. These can be either bootstrap provided class or your own class
- Act as an identifer for your element, so javascript can find it and do interactive things with it.

Instructor suggested to prefix any class created for the second usage with 'js-'.
I definitely like this. As I have started working with bootstrap more and more,
I have started so many CSS classes in my code, that some convention like this
is very useful.
