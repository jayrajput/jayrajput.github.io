title: Text email
---

Mutt is a text based email client and I have been successfully using it since
few days. My enthusiasm level is too high as I am able to just save amazing
amount of time. Here is how I got my configuration done:

I use MUTT only as an email client to read and write the email. The job of
retrieving the emails and sending the email are are done by fetchmail and
msmtp. I also use procmail in addition to mutt, fetchmail and msmtp. The
procmail is strictly not needed, but the every tutorial I read on the internet
was using procmail and I also ended up using it.

Configuration of mutt, procmail, fetchmail and msmtp are done by editing their
configuration files.

I also use following mutt addon to make my life easier

- urlviewer (to display the urls in the emails)
- feh  (to view images)
- elinks (to view html email)

The installation of all the components are done using yum install.

~~~
sudo yum install mutt procmail fetchmail msmtp urlview feh elinks
~~~

Al the configuration files can be seen at the end of the article.

Files which needs to be edited

- ~/.muttrc (Mutt configuration file)
- ~/.fetchmailrc (fetchmail configuration file)
- ~/.procmailrc  (procmail configuration file)
- ~/.msmtp   (msmtp - needed for sending emails)
- ~/.mailcap  (mail cap configuration - need for different MIME types)
- ~/.urlviewer

# Reading mails

Reading can be done in two views in mutt

- Index view (showing all the emails without their content)
- Pager view (showing single email with the content of email)

## Flags and their meaning

~~~
+ Sent only to me
T Sent to me and others
C Cced to you
F from you
N new mail (Received after the MUTT was started and not read)
O old mail (Received before the MUTT was started, but is not read)
D message is deleted
! message is flagged
* message is tagged
~~~

## Common commands

~~~
? help
^L refresh screen
~~~

## Index view commands

j Move down
k Move up
= go to the top
* go to the last email
<tab> move to next unread mail
C-r move to next thread and mark this thread as read
P jump to parent message
Esc v collapse thread
/ search for a mail
n go to next mail matching the search
m compose a mail
r reply
g reply all
q exit
c change to a different mailbox (like sent or postpone)
l show message matching a pattern
<Return> show message
~~~

## Pager view commands

~~~

# Writing mail

## How to write a new mail

Hit m to compose a mail. Provide value for To, Cc and subject. When down mutt
will open a new mail in an editor.  Once done with the editor close the editor
(for vim hit ZZ), mutt will ask what to do next:

~~~
y send mail
q abort 
p postpone mail (mail will be sent in postpone folder, similar to outlook drafts)
~~~

## How to respond to a mail

Hit these to reply to a mail and then follow the steps similar to use for writing a new mail

~~~
r reply only to the sender
g reply all
f forward mail
b bounce
a attach a file
A attach mails
~~~

# Configuration Files 

## ~/.fetmailrc 

configuration file has a weird syntax but works. Some people prefer getmail

~~~
set daemon 3600

poll mailserver.company.com protocol IMAP:
    user "jay.rajput@company.com" password "password"  is jarajput here 
    mda "/usr/bin/procmail -d %T"        
    keep                                 
    ssl                                  
~~~

## ~/.procmailrc 

I am not really using procmail for anything, but did not find any tutorial online to configure mutt without the procmail

~~~
PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin 
VERBOSE=off                   # Turn on for verbose log
MAILDIR=$HOME/Mail            # Where Procmail recipes deliver
LOGFILE=$HOME/.procmaillog    # Keep a log for troubleshooting.
# Recipes

## ~/.msmtprc 

I am connecting to davmail instance locally running as my email has only
provides Outlook WebAccess, so my configuration will differ from you and should
be much easier if you have direct POP3 or IMAP acccess.

~~~
defaults
logfile ~/.msmtp.log

account default              
host localhost
port 1025
protocol smtp
auth plain
from "jay.rajput@company.com"
user "jay.rajput@company.com"
password "password"       
tls off

## ~/.muttrc 

This configuration uses mbox format, and I am planning to move to maildir
