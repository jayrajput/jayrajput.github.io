title: Elinks google search page formatting
---

I use elinks for quick googling and elinks is great for it. Working on vim in
tmux, you might want to find the input arguments for the PHP array\_map
function. Rather than moving away from tmux and searching in firefox, I like
searching google in elinks. The search is loaded pretty fast but you have to
hit the down arrow multiple times to get to the first search. It will be nicer
to remove some of the not needed links in the google search page. There are two
steps for this: 

1. Enable scripting support in elinks 
2. Implement the perl pre\_format_url hook as per your requirements.


# Enable scripting support in elinks.

To enable scripting support in elinks, I had to compile elinks from source.
Steps to Compile
- git clone http://elinks.cz/elinks.git  && cd elinks
- ./autogen.sh
- ./configure --with-perl --with-guile
- make
- sudo make install

Once the scripting is enabled, it shall be visible in the elinks --version
output.  The output shall show the scripting support. If you do not see
scriping in the output, there has been some mistake. Check for error in
./configure.

# Implement the pre_format_html_hooks

Copy the hooks.pl and config.pl to the ~/.elinks folder. The hooks.pl and
config.pl can be found in the git clone elinks folder.

````perl
     if ($url =~ 'google\.com')
     {
         # make the page looks pretty by removing extra links
         # or use duckduckgo as your search engine
         $html =~ s/<div id=gbar.*?<\/div>//;
         $html =~ s/<div id=guser.*?<\/div>//;
         $html =~ s/<div>.*Any time.*?<\/div>//;
         my @links = ('Web', 'Google', 'Images', 'Videos', 'News', 'Shopping', 'Maps', 'Books');
         foreach my $link (@links) {
             $html =~ s/<a.*$link.*?<\/a>//;
         }
     }
