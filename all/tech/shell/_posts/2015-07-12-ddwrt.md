# Boost your wireless Signal

## identify the wireless channel.

To check what channels your neighbors are using, open the Web-GUI and navigate
to Status->Wireless. Click the "Site Survey" button at the bottom to view all
AP's nearby and use the information you learned above to pick your channel. You
may want to experiment with different channels but it is strongly recommend to
always keep your control channel set to either 1, 6, or 11 so that you minimize
interference for yourself and your neighbors.

## Update the wireless channel

- Choose Wireless Tab
- Select "Basic Settings" sub tab
- Find the Wireless Channel drop-down and select the channel you want
- Click Save, then click Apply Setting.
