title: Digital Ocean VNC
---

I have a DO VPS and was trying to run vnc on the server for running android
studio. The DO VPS I have is running Ubuntu 15.10. DO has a tutorial available,
but it is for Ubuntu 14.04 which uses upstart in place of systemd.

DO tutorial for VNC with Ubuntu 14.04

    https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-configure-vnc-on-ubuntu-14-04

The only change in the tutorial I had to made was to configure the vncserver as
systemd service in place of upstart.

The step to configure vncserver as systemd was stolen from step#4 from this tutorial
