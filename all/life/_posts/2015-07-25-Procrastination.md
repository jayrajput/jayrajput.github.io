title: Procrastination
---

I have seen myself procrastinating in my life. I started researching about the
topic and the revelation was surprising. Here are the notes for other chronic
procrastinator (and me to refer back). Each section is from a book and what I
learned from that.

<details>
    <summary>6 styles of Procrastination by Dr. Linda Sapadin with Jack Maguire</summary>

Linda defines six types of procrastination

- The Perfectionist: "...BUT I want it to be perfect!"
- The Dreamer: "...BUT I hate all those bothersome details!"
- The Worrier: "...BUT I am afraid to change!"
- The Defier: "...BUT why should I have to do it?"
- The Crisis-Maker: "BUT I only get motivated at the last minute!"
- The Overdoer: "BUT I have so much to do!"

Linda suggest that human beings display a mix of styles. Linda also explains
the role of childhood and past in developing these habits. The perfectionist is
seen as someone lacking self-esteem which might have happened if the family was
demanding and wanted you to score the good marks. In INDIA, society puts too
much pressure on the studies and I can relate with how to pressure can make you
a perfectionist.

After the definition, follows a self-assesment. Here are my results:

                  | Total | Major | Minor | Rank
    Crisis-Maker  | 10    | YES   |       | 1
    Over-doer     | 10    | YES   |       | 1
    Worrier       | 7     |       | YES   | 2
    Dreamer       | 5     |       | YES   | 3
    Defier        | 1     |       | YES   | 4
    Perfectionist | 0     |       | YES   | 5

I am not fan of these self-assesment test, so let us see how it goes.

Example of Perfectionist procrastinators are given. There are some who work
real hard and long hours to make their work perfect. Some do not start to work,
procrastinating, so that they can make an excuse that they were not able
to deliver a perfect result because of the lack of the time.
