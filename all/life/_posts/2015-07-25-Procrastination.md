I have seen myself procrastinating in my life. I started researching about the
topic and the revelation were surprising. Here are the notes for other chronic
procrastinator. Each section is from a book and what I learned from that.

# 6 styles of Procrastination by Dr. Linda Sapadin with Jack Maguire

Linda defines six types of procrastination

- The Perfectionist: "...BUT I want it to be perfect!"
- The Dreamer: "...BUT I hate all those bothersome details!"
- The Worrier: "...BUT I am afraid to change!"
- The Defier: "...BUT why should I have to do it?"
- The Crisis-Maker: "BUT I only get motivated at the last minute!"
- The Overdoer: "BUT I have so much to do!"

Linda suggest that human beings display a mix of styles. Linda also explains
the role of childhood and past in developing these habits. The perfectionist is
seen as someone lacking self-esteem which might have happened if the family was
demanding and wanted you to score the good marks. In INDIA, society puts too
much pressure on the studies and I can relate with how to pressure can make you
a perfectionist.

After the definition, follows a self-assesment. Here are my results:

                  | Total | Major | Minor | Rank
    Crisis-Maker  | 10    | YES   |       | 1
    Over-doer     | 10    | YES   |       | 1
    Perfectionist | 8     |       | YES   | 2
    Worrier       | 7     |       | YES   | 3
    Dreamer       | 5     |       | YES   | 4
    Defier        | 1     |       | YES   | 5

I am not fan of these self-assesment test, so let us see how it goes.
