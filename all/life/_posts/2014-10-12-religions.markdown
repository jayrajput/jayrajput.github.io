Religion is an interesting topic to me. For me, religion has provided me answers
to many questions and given me happiness. I am HINDU by birth. But I also
learned a lot from other religions. Here are my notes/learning about different
religion:

# Hinduism
# Christianity

Things which I like about Christianty. 

* Christians have the notion of dedicating Sunday to God. Sunday is considered
as day of God. Imagine yourself waking up on a Sunday, and only thing you have
to do is to dedicate to God. You need not think about your problems.

# Jainism

Jainpedia is a good place to learn about the same.
